Creating a  pipeline with a user interface that uploads operators to a remote repository:

1. **Install Required Plugins:**

Make sure you have the following plugins installed in Jenkins:
- Blue Ocean (To enable the visual pipeline editor)
- Pipeline Utility Steps (For user input)

2. **Create Jenkins Pipeline:**

In your Jenkins instance, create a new Pipeline job and select "Pipeline script from SCM" as the definition. Then, specify the SCM repository where your Jenkinsfile will be stored.

3. **Create Jenkinsfile:**

In the root of your SCM repository, create a Jenkinsfile with the content of the operator_upload.jenkinsfile:

4. **Visualize Pipeline in Blue Ocean:**

Save the Jenkinsfile in your SCM repository and trigger the Jenkins job. You can then navigate to the Blue Ocean interface (usually accessible at `<YOUR_JENKINS_URL>/blue`) to view and interact with the pipeline.

When you run the job, the pipeline will pause at the "User Input" stage and prompt you for input using a UI. Once you provide the values, the pipeline will continue and run the `oc-mirror` command with the specified variables.

Now you have a full Jenkins Pipeline with a user interface to receive input from the user!
